# Phase 2: IMPORTANT - Your WiFi Doesn't Support Hotspot

## Issue Discovered

Your Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201 adapter **does not support Windows Hosted Network** feature.

```
Hosted network supported  : No
```

This means we cannot create a software WiFi hotspot directly from your built-in WiFi.

## Updated Solutions (Ranked)

### ⭐ Solution 1: USB WiFi Adapter (BEST - $15-30)

Buy a USB WiFi adapter that supports Access Point (AP) mode.

**Recommended Models:**
- **TP-Link Archer T3U Plus** (~$25) - AC1300, Hosted Network support
- **TP-Link TL-WN722N** (~$15) - Budget option, good for testing
- **Netgear A6210** (~$35) - High performance

**Why this is best:**
- ✅ Both networks active simultaneously
- ✅ Clean network separation
- ✅ Professional test environment
- ✅ Easy to set up
- ✅ Reusable for future projects

**Setup after purchase:**
1. Plug in USB adapter
2. Install drivers
3. Use built-in WiFi: Internet (192.168.8.x)
4. Use USB WiFi: Hotspot for IoT (192.168.10.x)
5. Run our Node.js proxy

**Timeline:** Order today, setup tomorrow

### Solution 2: Connect PC via Ethernet

Use Ethernet for your PC's internet, free up WiFi for hotspot testing.

**Requirements:**
- Ethernet cable
- Access to Ethernet port (at your desk or via adapter)

**Setup:**
1. Connect PC to network via Ethernet
2. Disable WiFi client connection
3. Use Windows Mobile Hotspot from WiFi adapter
4. Some adapters support this even if "Hosted Network" says No

**Let's test if this works:**

```powershell
# Try to create Mobile Hotspot via Settings
# Settings → Network & Internet → Mobile hotspot
# Share from: Ethernet
# Share over: Wi-Fi
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ No additional purchase
- ✅ Might work even though hosted network unsupported

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Not portable
- ⚠️ May still not work with your adapter

### Solution 3: Use a Raspberry Pi as WiFi Bridge

If you have a Raspberry Pi laying around:

**Setup:**
1. Raspberry Pi connects to your WiFi via WiFi adapter
2. Raspberry Pi creates hotspot on second WiFi/Ethernet
3. Portenta H7 connects to Pi's hotspot
4. Pi acts as gateway (192.168.10.1)
5. Your PC connects to Pi to run proxy

**This is overkill but educational!**

---

### Solution 4: Test with Virtual Router Software

Try third-party software that might support your adapter:

**Options:**
- **MyPublicWiFi** (free)
- **Connectify Hotspot** (paid, but has free trial)
- **mHotspot** (free)

These sometimes work when Windows built-in doesn't.

**Let's try MyPublicWiFi:**

1. Download from: https://www.mypublicwifi.com/
2. Install and run as Administrator
3. Configure:
   - Network Name: `IoT-Test-Network`
   - Password: `TestIoT2025`
   - Enable Internet Sharing

**May or may not work with your adapter**

### Solution 5: Simplified Testing (No Hotspot)

For pure testing/learning without full isolation:

**Setup:**
1. Connect Portenta H7 to your EXISTING WiFi (192.168.8.x)
2. Assign it static IP: 192.168.8.150
3. Run Node.js proxy on your PC
4. Configure Portenta H7 to route through proxy
5. Test proxy functionality

**Pros:**
- ✅ Can test TODAY
- ✅ Learn Node.js proxy concepts
- ✅ No hardware needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not true VLAN isolation
- ❌ Not representative of client setup
- ❌ Missing network segmentation

---

## My Recommendation

### For Learning & Client Demo:
**Buy USB WiFi Adapter ($15-25)**

### For Today (Immediate Testing):
**Use Solution 5** - Connect Portenta H7 to existing WiFi, test proxy concepts

### Timeline:

**Today:**
1. Order USB WiFi adapter online (~$20)
2. Use Solution 5 to start building Node.js proxy
3. Test proxy functionality on same network

**Tomorrow/Next Day:**
4. USB adapter arrives
5. Create proper isolated network
6. Full VLAN-like setup complete

---

## Let's Proceed with What We Can Do Today

Since you can't create a hotspot right now, let's:

1. ✅ **Start building the Node.js proxy server** (Phase 3)
2. ✅ **Test it on your existing network** (same subnet, 192.168.8.x)
3. ✅ **Configure Portenta H7** to use the proxy
4. ⏳ **Wait for USB WiFi adapter** to create true isolation

This way, you're making progress on the proxy server logic while waiting for hardware.

## Phase 2 Action Items

### Option A: Order USB WiFi & Continue
- [ ] Order USB WiFi adapter (TP-Link Archer T3U Plus recommended)
- [ ] Proceed to Phase 3: Build Node.js proxy
- [ ] Test on existing network (192.168.8.x)
- [ ] Return to Phase 2 when adapter arrives

### Option B: Try Ethernet Connection
- [ ] Connect PC via Ethernet cable
- [ ] Try Windows Mobile Hotspot
- [ ] If it works: Continue with isolated network
- [ ] If not: Fall back to Option A

### Option C: Try Third-Party Software
- [ ] Download MyPublicWiFi or Connectify
- [ ] Attempt to create hotspot
- [ ] If successful: Continue Phase 2
- [ ] If not: Use Option A
